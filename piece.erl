%% @doc Maneuver is a function that determines the validity of the
%% attempted move, Location is an {x, y} tuple that indicates where
%% the piece is at the moment, and Team is black or white.
%%
%% Eventually I'll need additional PIDs to be passed in, like an
%% object to decide whether I'm pinned, something to help me decide
%% whether there are pieces in my way, etc.
%%
%% First step: just make the move.
